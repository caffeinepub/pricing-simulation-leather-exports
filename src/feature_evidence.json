Your company operates in five different export markets, each with different cost structures and production capacities. In every market, you must choose a selling price. Demand depends on the price you select, and production is subject to capacity constraints. Some markets involve fixed operating costs, while others do not. In one market, you also have the option to enter or stay out. Your objective is to maximize total profit across all five markets. The goal is not to sell the highest quantity, but to carefully balance price, demand, cost, and capacity to achieve the highest overall profitability. Make your pricing decisions strategically and observe how they impact revenue, cost, and profit in each market.'",
